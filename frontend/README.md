 # Frontend
 
 Run the frontend (dev):
 
 ```powershell
 cd frontend
 npm start
 ```
 
Default app runs on http://localhost:3000 and calls backend on http://localhost:3001.

UI enhancements
- Uses Inter font (Google Fonts) and a refined maritime color palette for an elegant, industry-ready UI.
- Replaced all emoji icons with professional icons from `react-icons`.

Testing
- A small component test was added for `CompareTab` (uses React Testing Library). Run `npm run test` to execute frontend tests.
 
 Run tests:
 
 ```powershell
 cd frontend
 npm run test
 ```
